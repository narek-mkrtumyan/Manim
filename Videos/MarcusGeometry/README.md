# Problem1

    How must be the orientation of the point and the segment, such that one can draw a circle with
    center at the point, that passes through the endpoints of the segment.

# Problem2

    Let AB is the diameter and AC is a chord of the circle with center O. Let K be the midpoint of AC. Find the length of the segment BC if it is known that OK=4sm.

# Problem3

    Prove that the three points on the same line doesn't belong to the same circle.

# Problem4

    Let AB be the diameter of the circle with the center O and let the chords AC and BC are equal, Find angle AOC.

# Problem5

    Draw a circle of given radius that passed the given 2 points.
